Draft results and Findings

Steps: 
1. Import the CSV file into a SQL database using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio
2. Create SQL statements 
3. Draw findings 
4. Interpret the results 

I have defined user engagements to check off four points:
1. Projects added 
2. Comments given 
3. Likes given 
4. Number of times they logged in

Question: Is there a correlation between bugs and user engagement? 


Customer 87265 had the highest duration of 2395 during Session 84773. 
There were 0 bugs during this session. 
They have logged in a total of 12 times during the month of October. 
Out of the 8 sessions which checked off the projects, likes, and comments given, there were 6 bugs total.

Customer 40572 had the lowest duration of 32 during Session 310751. 
There were 3 bugs during this session. 
They have logged in a total of 16 times during the month of October. 
Out of the 6 sessions which checked off the projects, likes, and comments given, there were 11 bugs total.

We find customer 40572 part of the list with having one of the highest bugs encountered which is 5. 

Conclusion: The amount of bugs a customer experiences can impact their productivity and activity during a given session. 
Compared to the user with the longest duration they only experienced 6 bugs in total during the month of October. 
The user with the shortest duration had experienced 11 bugs in total during the month of October. 

Additional Metrics: 
1. Specifiy the date to be a weekend or weekday. 
2. What times during the day exhbited most/least activity.
